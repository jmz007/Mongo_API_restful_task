# Mongo_API_restful_task
Coding Assignment: create an application with endpoints (routing rules) which offer CRUD operations for 'tasks'.

GET: Retrieve all Tasks

GET: Retrieve a Task by ID

The tasks should be responded in a json format. Consider the tasks being objects with the following properties:

_id: (string) (default id generated by mongoDB)
title: (string)
description: (string, default to empty string)
completed: (boolean, default to: false)
created_at: (date, default to current date)
updated_at: (date, default to current date)
